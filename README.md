# Pewlett_Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

This analysis was brought up due to the large number of Pewlett Hackard employees reaching retirement status. This project brought together two aspects of finding certain retiring individuals. The first task was to find the number of employees retiring by title. The second task was to find the employees that were eligible for the "Mentorship Program". Using this analysis, the company can make solid decisions on how to shape their future and better handle the "silver tsunami". 

## Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. 

- The number of retiring employees is very high, approximately 133,776 people!

- The number of unique titles retring is 72,458 people.

- The number of employees eligible for mentorship is 1549

- There are six titles that are eligible for Mentorship

## How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact? Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

The number of roles to be filled will be over one hundred and thirty thousand employees. Currently there are about 1500 employees ready to participate in the mentorship.
